- 👋 Hi, I’m @bludrgn311
- 👀 I’m interested in C# and .NET development, both for desktop and web application. I'm also big fan of cloud computing, mainly AWS but I also dabble in Azure.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C#/.NET Core for both web development and game development. I'm also working on expanding my understanding of PostgreSQL.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on C#/.NET Core web and/or video game projects. I'm very new to both, but I have been working with C# professionally for 3+ years now.
- 📫 You can reach me via my Twitter account linked in my profile at the moment.

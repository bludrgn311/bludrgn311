- 👋 Hi, I’m @bludrgn311
- 👀 I’m interested in C# and .NET development, both for desktop and web application. I'm also big fan of cloud computing, mainly AWS but I also dabble in Azure.
- 🌱 I’m currently re-enforcing my C#/.NET Core knowledge. I also enjoy dabbling in other languages such as C++, Java, Python, GDScript, HTML/CSS, and JavaScript for example.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on C#/GDScript/Web projects, with a bigger focus in Game Development. I have been working with C# professionally for 3+ years and would love to expand my experience to areas I have more of a passion for.
- 📫 You can reach me via my Twitter account linked in my profile at the moment.
